  <b>Unreal plugin that integrates tools to procedurally generate power lines.</b>
</p>

## Introduction and motivations

The idea of this plugin is offering a suite of useful tools to easily build the power grid of your games or environments.

In my journey learning 3D environment art I discovered that a huge amount of environments needed a power grid and it was a VERY tedious job to set up with a more traditional approach.

I also found [Any Austin](https://www.youtube.com/@any_austin)'s videos trying to make sense of popular video games' power grids and wanted to make a tool that helped developers create more believable worlds in that sense.

## Installation

The plugin can be adquired in [Fab](https://fab.com/s/df6499c5a50f) or cloned or downloaded for free from [GitHub](https://github.com/Bumvolla/EasyPowerLines).

If you got Git installed on your computer you can clone the repository by typing this command in a terminal in your engine "Plugins/Marketplace" folder or your project "Plugins" folder:


~~~
git clone https://github.com/Bumvolla/EasyPowerLines.git
~~~

or, if you already got your unreal project in a git repository:


~~~
git submodule add https://github.com/Bumvolla/EasyPowerLines.git
~~~



If not, you can download the .zip file in the [latest release](https://github.com/Bumvolla/EasyPowerLines/releases/latest) and extract it in your project "Plugins" folder
## Features

- Performant power lines procedural generation
- Acurate paralel catenary calculation
- Class preset based construction
- Randomization
- Terrain snaping

### Spline utility pole
Build your power line with one single spline, you can determine spacing, randomization and way more parameters.
Poles have terrain snapping and alignement.

### Utility pole
Single pole that will connect to another single pole, you can determine wire slack, randomization and way more parameters.
Poles have terrain snapping and alignement.

### Point to point catenary
One single mathematically acurate catenary that goes from a world space point to another, you can determine wire slack.

### Point to point catenary
Same as point to point catenary but with a sequence of points instead of 2, you can determine wire slack and randomization
